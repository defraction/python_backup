# Conclusion Questions
# Sun, 09 Dec 2018 23:42:18
# 1. I do not know what I want automated by a program, because it seems that everything around us that needs to be automated is already automated.
# Sun, 09 Dec 2018 23:45:49
# 2. The native types learned in this activity are floats, ints, booleans, and strings. Although, only floats and ints were mainly used throughout the activity.

# 3. The ipython can be used to run commands and simple equations of arithmatic, but by using the code editor, you can make more complicated functions and edit them as you develop the program more.

# 4. An advantage of putting code into a function is being able to execute that function multiple times with only one block, instead of having to keep writing out the same lines of code every time.

# 5. After running the code, the results were the answers for the respective functions. I think that this is the last conclusion question to this assignment to check the functions created work properly.
